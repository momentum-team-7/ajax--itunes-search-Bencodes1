also- changed form settings thanks to Laura's suggetsion, that's why your placeholder stopped showing up


order of things: 

inside loop: 

1. image of album (if no image/undefined? )
2. song (album hover over if time)
3. artist

how do we see variables/vals in developer tools? 

To do:
1. Code in error messages
2. input validate (don't run til ready)
